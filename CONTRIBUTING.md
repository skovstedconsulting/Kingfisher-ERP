# Contributing

First of all: **thank you for being here** ❤️  
This project exists because ERP systems are too important to be left only to “clever code”.

If you have **ERP, accounting, finance, logistics, VAT, or business-process knowledge**, you are *especially* welcome — even if you don’t consider yourself a programmer.

---

## Core principles

### 1. Everyone can contribute
- You **do not** need to be a “good coder”
- You **do not** need to know Django / Python / SQL deeply
- You **do not** need to write perfect code

ERP knowledge, real-world experience, and common sense matter more than syntax.

---

### 2. Simplicity over smartness
We strongly prefer:
- readable code over clever code
- explicit logic over abstractions
- boring solutions over “elegant” ones

If a junior ERP consultant can understand it, it’s good code.

---

### 3. ERP people first
The main goal is to make the codebase:
- understandable to **ERP consultants**
- readable by **accountants**
- explainable to **business stakeholders**

This means:
- clear naming
- explicit models
- few “magic” patterns
- comments that explain *why*, not just *how*

---

## What kind of contributions are welcome?

### ✔ Feature requests
You don’t need to implement anything.
If you can describe:
- a business problem
- an ERP workflow
- a real customer scenario

That’s already a valuable contribution.

Open an issue and describe it in **plain language**.

---

### ✔ Feature design
Before coding, we care about:
- data models
- accounting impact
- posting logic
- edge cases (VAT, currency, rounding, periods)

Diagrams, text descriptions, or pseudo-flows are perfect.

---

### ✔ Testing & validation
Especially welcome:
- “This breaks in real life”
- “This is not how accountants think”
- “This would fail during audit”

You don’t need to write automated tests — feedback and examples are enough.

---

### ✔ Interfaces & UX
ERP systems live or die by usability.

Suggestions about:
- screen flows
- field naming
- defaults
- validation rules

are just as important as backend code.

---

### ✔ Code (if you want to)
Pull requests are welcome from anyone.

At the **current stage of the project**:
- **New features and functionality are prioritised over code quality**
- Refactoring can wait
- Perfection is not the goal

If it works and is understandable, it’s good enough.

---

## What we *don’t* optimise for (yet)

- Micro-optimisations
- Fancy patterns
- “Clean code” purity
- Framework cleverness
- Abstract over-engineering

Those can come later — *after* the ERP model is right.

---

## How to contribute (practically)

### Issues
- Use issues for ideas, questions, and problems
- Plain language is preferred
- Screenshots, examples, or real cases help a lot

### Pull requests
- Small PRs are easier to review
- Explain **why** the change exists
- Don’t worry about style too much

### Discussions
If you’re unsure:
- open an issue
- ask a question
- describe the problem instead of the solution

---

## Code of conduct (short version)

Be kind.  
Be patient.  
Assume good intent.

ERP is complex. People come from different backgrounds.  
That diversity is a strength.

---

## Final note

If you know:
- accounting
- VAT
- finance
- logistics
- inventory
- projects
- real ERP pain points

…then **this project needs you**, even if you never write a single line of code.

You are very welcome here.
